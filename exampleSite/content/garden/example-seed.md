I've been thinking about how digital gardens differ from traditional blogs.

The key insight: **gardens grow, blogs decay**.

Traditional blog posts are:
- Published once
- Rarely updated
- Time-stamped and archived
- Expected to be "complete"

Digital gardens are:
- Continuously tended
- Revised and expanded
- Organized by connection, not time
- Allowed to be incomplete

This feels more authentic to how we actually learn and think. Ideas evolve. Understanding deepens. Why shouldn't our writing reflect that?

## Questions to explore

- How do we signal the maturity/confidence level of an idea?
- What's the right balance between structure and organic growth?
- How do we make connections between ideas visible?
