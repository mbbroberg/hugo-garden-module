**Update 2024-02-03:** Added connection to digital gardens and expanded on vulnerability.

---

Learning in public is both terrifying and liberating.

The traditional educational model teaches us to only share completed work—polished, perfect, ready for judgment. But this creates a problem: **we hide all the messy, generative parts of learning**.

## Why share the process?

1. **It normalizes struggle** - When experts only share finished work, learners think the path to mastery is smooth. It's not.

2. **It invites collaboration** - Half-formed ideas attract people who can help shape them. Finished ideas just collect likes.

3. **It creates serendipity** - You never know who needs to hear your "obvious" insight.

## Connection to digital gardens

This is why digital gardens resonate with me. They're inherently about learning in public. Every seed is a small act of vulnerability: "Here's something I'm thinking about, even though I don't fully understand it yet."

The growth stages (seed → sprout → rhizome) make the learning process visible and acceptable.

## The vulnerability factor

It's scary to plant seeds. What if my thinking is wrong? What if I look stupid?

But I'm finding that:
- People appreciate authenticity more than perfection
- Most "mistakes" are just steps in understanding
- The community that forms around learning > the community that forms around knowing
