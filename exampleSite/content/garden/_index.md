Welcome to my digital garden! This is a place where ideas grow organically over time.

Unlike traditional blog posts that are "finished" when published, garden entries are living documents that evolve as my understanding deepens.

**Growth stages:**

- 🌱 **Seeds** are brand new ideas, just planted
- 🌿 **Sprouts** are developing thoughts with emerging connections
- 🫚 **Rhizomes** are mature, well-connected ideas that support other growth

Feel free to explore by growth stage or by topic. Come back often—things are always growing!
